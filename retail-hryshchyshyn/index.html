        <h1>Teodora Hryshchyshyn: Portfolio Redesign</h1>
       
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        
        <p>For my independent project, I plan to redesign and enhance my portfolio website on the Squarespace platform. I have previously created a couple of different portfolio websites, both a coded one and one built on WordPress. While I do have a Squarespace account and the beginnings of a portfolio website built there, there is much work to be done in regard to the information architecture, visual design, and usability of the website.</p>

        <p>Developing a portfolio website on Squarespace not only allows me to develop technical skills for the Squarespace platform, but gives me the opportunity to showcase my work in one centralized location to future employers and to those curious about my projects. Prior to the interactive design concentration, I was a creative advertising concentration. My interest in the research of individuals crossed over, so while I enjoyed collecting information about target audiences in my advertising course, I love to conduct user research in my interactive design courses. I have an interest in developing my own personalized logo as well, so I will be watching a LinkedIn Learning course on that.</p>

        <p>My projects are currently spread throughout multiple websites and description heavy. I would want to centralize the information and gather the projects onto one website for easier access. I enjoy photography and digital art as well, so I would like to incorporate those aspects into my portfolio as well, by designing project icons and showcasing my photography.</p>

        <p>Given my background in advertising, I would want to work in the UX department of an advertising agency, similar to what I am doing currently with my internship. Because I am targeting and designing for employers that hire in both the UX/UI field and the advertising field, I have to ensure that I am not only including a variety of projects, but that I have skillsets applicable to both industries. Similarly, because I would want to take on future projects that involve research, I have to redesign my website in a way that demonstrates that I can present my findings in a way that is comprehensive, yet manageable to a busy individual reviewing the projects I have worked on. At the moment, my project descriptions are long and overwhelming on some websites and nonexistent on others. I seek to develop a balance between the visual and written components. Reading technically wrong has also influenced some elements of my website that I would want to change, whether that be something small like including my pronouns, or a bit more involved like improving usability by eliminating downloads.</p>

        <p>I have decided to improve my website because many of the jobs I am applying to require a website when asking for a portfolio. Presenting my projects visually enables the viewer to digest the information more easily and through the presence of a well-designed website - good information architecture, usability, readability, etc. - I am applying and showcasing my skills in this field yet another time. It is one more way that I can “prove” my abilities.</p>
